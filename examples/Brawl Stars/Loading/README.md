<h1 align="center" style="font-size: 26px;"> Custom Loading in Brawl Stars </h1>

Generic loading in ["loading.fla"](./loading.fla) file  

<br/>

Loading is a bit tricky because it uses a 9-slice which requires some preparation. If you are using sc2fla in Python, then you need to turn all 9slice shapes into fills with a solid fill. Also you need to disable auto kerning in all textfields, otherwise it will not work for some reason.
But I have already made all these preparations and am sharing here a fla that you can customize as you want and export.
